AI-Driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System
Background: Crop diseases can devastate yields, leading to significant financial losses for farmers. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for effective management. Description: Develop an AI-driven system that analyzes crop images and environmental data to predict potential disease outbreaks. This system will provide farmers with actionable insights and treatment recommendations to mitigate risks. Expected Solution: A mobile and web-based application that utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify crop diseases and suggest preventive measures and treatments based on real-time data.



AI for Farmers - Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation, Pest Recognition, and Guidelines
Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-driven solution to assist farmers in improving their crop yield and health. The system provides recommendations for crops and fertilizers, recognizes pests, and offers proper guidelines for sustainable farming practices.

Features
Crop Recommendation: Suggests suitable crops based on soil quality, weather conditions, and other environmental factors.
Fertilizer Recommendation: Recommends the best fertilizers to improve crop yield, tailored to the soil's nutritional content.
Pest Recognition: AI-based recognition of pests through image analysis and suggests pest control measures.
Guidelines: Provides best farming practices and guidelines for improved agricultural outcomes.
